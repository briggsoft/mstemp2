Mediocre Software is an independent software company that offers high quality software to any web-based user.
We offer software developed by a real human with emotion, at little or no cost. But the value is not in the product, the value is in your time. Our software does what most mainstream software companies fail to accomplish like, software that makes you question your gender, software that makes you fill out forms as a reward, gather information about the human thats using the software, software that questions the user's sexual orientation in order to continue a story line or a quest within a game.
Companies like Bethesda software always asks for you gender in every game they make.
We promise when we make an RPG game we will never ask you for your gender so that you will never feel uncomfortable in real life. Blizzard Entertainment makes the same mistake, no wonder their user count is going down. In 2010 Blizzard had 12 million subscribers and now its down to only 6.7 million. because their company failed to accomplish the publics cry for help. Not us, we offer maximum replay-ability, endless content and weekly updates. As you can see we put a lot of time and effort into our products and hope to get your joy in return. You can use software like.

You play as one of the villagers of skyrim and your tired of the dovahkiin's shit. You are one of the quest givers that gave a quest to dovahkin and you watch him as he gets on his shitty horse and kills the innocent town people of riverwood. He steals their loot, disrespects the town guards, always shouts at people and never shares his loot with his quest companions. Hes a part of a underground gang, hes the cause of the civil war and it was his fault the stupid dragons came back. Now these dumb dragons are flying around everywhere, eating my crops and taking away my woman and all hes doing is shouting at them. Joy me on my journey as we follow dovhakiins footsteps into his downfall and bring peace back to skyrim. So i can return back to a NPC.
